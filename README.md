# Floor Asplosion

#### A browser-based, multi-themed minesweeper game built with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. December 18, 2017

#### By **Sailor Winkelman, Holly Wilkalis, and Luke Bertram**

## Description

At its heart this project is a browser-based version of the classic Windows game, Minesweeper. Our addition to this staple of office time-wasting lies primarily in an injection of responsive style and user-customizable style. Through the power of Sassy CSS our version abandons minesweeper's traditional spartan design in favor of a theme that can be changed at the user's discretion.
